# Reading Skeleton Crew in the Pandemic

I'm a high school English teacher, and this is my first reddit post, and I kind of geeked out on this play and thought maybe I'd share. *Skeleton Crew* is a political play, and it's hard to ignore politics while writing about it, but what I like is that it doesn't make claims, but it makes me ask questions. The fact that I can't really make out the answers to them is what I enjoy most about the work. What I'm really interested in is the connection I think we can make between this book and what's going on now with the pandemic.

The context is that Dominique Morisseau wrote *Skeleton Crew* in response to the economic crisis of 2008. The play is brief and focused: it tells the story of four workers in Detroit as their stamping factory closes down, told in two acts that both take place in the break room. It's an interesting play in its own right---one that draws out a deep story filled with romance, humor, and tragedy even in its limited time---but what brings it to mind now is that this term, "skeleton crew," keeps popping up in the news as companies respond to the pandemic. The new skeleton crews aren't the last ones to leave as a company closes, but the only ones to stay as a company tries to stay alive: the "essential workers". With that in mind, I think this book is worth returning to because it has something to say about today's essential workers. How does it happen that people work against their own interests for the benefit of the company?

This idea is all over the story, but one scene, without spoiling anything, really captures this problem with terrible poignancy. Faye, an older factory worker and the union leader, has heard from Reggie, the foreman, that the plant is going to close. Reggie, at the time, asked Faye that she not tell anyone because he's trying to work with management to keep things running smoothly in the meantime. The reasons Faye agrees to this are interesting issues in themselves (and the story definitely goes there), but she does, and now in this scene she has to listen to her coworker, the younger, pregnant Shanita, talk of passing on a job offer at a copy center in preference to her job at the plant. 

Faye. Always nice to have somethin' behind you in case you need to cover yo' ass.

Shanita. Cover my ass for what? Do somethin' I don't believe in? I figure ya'll is right. Time to stop worryin' about something that may not happen. Workin' in this industry is what I do. Uncertainty is always there. But it's the work I'm made of. In me from my daddy. Wanted a son but got me instead. Always been good with my hands, and this somethin' that makes him proud of me. Not bein' pregnant before I'm married. Not being over twenty-five and building a family by myself. But this? Being a highly skilled job-setter...that's something I can stand on. Everybody can't say that. Everybody can't do what I do. I belong here. Ride it 'til the wheels fall off. Right? (41)

With the stakes this high, with a child coming and the pressing need for all the manifold things a child needs, there's something keeping her at the plant instead of leaving for a better opportunity. 

This invites questions about the way work "works". Right now Marx is getting a lot of play in talking about politics, and it's tempting to read Marx into the devaluation of the worker: "with the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion the devaluation of the world of men. Labor produces no only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity" (657)(LINK). The problem is Shanita isn't acting at all like an alienated laborer: she's invested in her work at the plant to the point where she'll risk her future for it. In the same way I wonder about essential workers. On the one hand, I hear often that they are going to work without a choice, depending on the wages to provide for themselves and their families. On the other hand, however, there's a lot of talk of them being "heroes." How many of us have seen a picture of a nurse or trucker on Facebook with a "Hero of the Day" or some such stamp on it? It's interesting that these messages are popping up right when these workers are worth critically more than their pay reflects and yet we all need them to keep working. Could it be this is part of the same force at working both on Shanita and the essential workers, except different in its effectiveness?

Dez, another character romantically interested in Shanita, sheds light on this question. He's in the same situation with the impending closure, but instead of committing to the plant, he's committed to the idea of opening an auto-repair shop. "Found me a garage over on six mile. All I gotta do is save me enough to buy it outright. Few more months of overtime, I'm in there" (11). Just as Shanita's faithfulness to the plant keeps her working overtime, the dream of running a company himself keeps Dez working his. Two people working crazy hours of overtime for a company that wants to use them to get every cent they can before closing down for good---without anyone forcing them to work as hard as they do! What if they're receiving ideological violence instead of physically being forced to work? Althusser suggests there are "apparatuses" at work, shaping the way people think of themselves to create exactly the kind of behavior beneficial to those who gain value from their work.

What if there's an apparatus applying itself to "essential workers", but it's failing? A pandemic is a powerful experience, it may be that it's forcing us to face and evaluate what we think is good, appropriate, and natural behavior for us as workers, and that we may have greater priorities as human beings that we're not necessarily willing to sacrifice for the job anymore. The play looks both at the material reality of the worker's situation in one very much like this, while also showing us how our own way of thinking can keep us trapped in situations against our insterests. 

BUT, it undermines this kind of reading at the same time, because as much as it looks like exploitation, Shanita does find real value in her work; while it's possible to criticize Dez for thinking limited to a capitalist ideology, isn't it a legitimate desire to want to want to do the work you love? I tend to lean left pretty hard, but I like that *Skeleton Crew* forced me to acknowledge the weaknesses in my thinking. So in the same way, "essential workers" may also be simply a recognition of the dignity of services we all didn't know we depended so heavily on?

(And maybe the real function of this long post is to show that this small play provides a lot to talk about?)

tldr; Skeleton Crew is a short, interesting play worth reading because it provokes questions about what's going on with calling laborers "essential workers" and "heroes".
