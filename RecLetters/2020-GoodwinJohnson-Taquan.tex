\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Taquan Goodwin Johnson for your undergraduate academic program. Taquan was my student in English 3 last year, and he was a capable, interesting student to have in the class.

Taquan has a good mind for literature. Thinking back on my experiences with Taquan, I immediately think of the way he contributed to our class discussions, especially of his creativity and bravery. Taquan is a careful listener and thoughtful reader, and generally every time we talked about a text his hand would go up. But Taquan didn't just make a comment or ask a question: so many times he had an extended idea that he wanted to explain to us and hear our thoughts about. He showed intellectual bravery in proposing ideas that he clearly wasn't sure about, or that he was developing as he spoke. Naturally at these times students might snicker, but no matter what Taquan persisted. This was always something I tried to encourage in his writing as well, because when his creative originality paid off, and when he pursued his best ideas, it paid off big.

I think undergraduate studies are going to be a space where Taquan thrives. The way he thinks is kind of like the way research works, and this is one kid I can see getting lost in a library or a paper (in a good way!). I don't often come across students who pursue their original thinking like Taquan does, and I value this kind of academic authenticity. Adding to this intellectual curiosity his kind nature and positive attitude---Taquan was the kind of group member who got along with everyone and led by example---and I believe Taquan will be a great addition to your community as a whole.

\closing{Sincerely,}
