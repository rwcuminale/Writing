\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Jefrey Lopez Munoz for undergraduate studies. I had Jefrey last year in English 3, and he was a thoughtful, engaged student.

Jefrey was always one of the first to arrive to class every day, and this was the final period when the students were usually dragging. He always brought with him a down-to-earth cheerfulness to the classroom that I found energizing both in myself and in those who sat with him. He seems to me to be a student who understands the value of his education, not only because of his demeanor in the course, but also through his commitment to a Europe trip that year. Jefrey is the kind of student who likes to learn about the world around him, and this is the perfect attitude to bring to undergraduate work. This disposition is also revealed in his growth as a reader, writer, and thinker.

Jefrey is also level-headed. In class and in the coursework, he knew how to tackle difficult tasks, and he was cheerful no matter what the circumstances. He knows how to ask good questions, and how to follow through. When he committed to the opportunity to study abroad, he exhibited responsibility in planning ahead in keeping on top of his studies; when he experienced some significant challenges outside of school, he communicated openly and made his best efforts, never getting off-track. Post-secondary work demands the character to pursue your goals even when no one is pushing you, and I believe Jefrey will do this.

Given the chance, Jefrey will be a good edition to your academic community. His kind good-nature, strong character, and academic authenticity will lead him to make the most of the opportunities you provide.

\closing{Sincerely,}
