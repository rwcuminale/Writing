\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Franklin Appiah to your undergraduate academic program. I taught Franklin last year when he was a Junior in English 3, and I believe he is a solid English student.

A professor having Franklin in their class would find an alert, intelligent, attentive student. His compositions were clearly written, and his readings of the course texts were quite capable. He's a quiet student, but also one who I always found engaged when working through a lesson. It's interesting to think back on this too, because Franklin was a student who found himself sitting with more energetic, and sometimes disruptive, students, but he was something like a calming force. They never got to him, but he definitely had an effect on them. Franklin strikes me as the kind of person who keeps his head above water even where there's commotion around him. I liked having him in the course because I could count on him to be consistent, and I think that's one of the most important parts of personal growth, and an indicator of success in post-secondary studies. 

I hope you give Franklin a chance to join your academic community. I think you'll find him an ambitious, able student, and one who can make the most of the opportunities you provide him.

\closing{Sincerely,}
