\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to strongly recommend Stanislav (Stan) Rakov to your undergraduate program. Stan was a delight to have in my English 3 classroom last year, and I am confident he will be a delight to your professors as well. He is the combination of an energetic personality, a confident speaker, and a capable writer, all making him an excellent all-around student.

As I'm sure he wrote about in his college essay, Stan is a fighter. I mean this literally, as mixed martial arts is a passion for him. In class he he would always juke and throw a fake punch whenever he passed me by, and during down-time before and after class he would often shadow-box with his friends. Even my untrained eye could see that he is \emph{good}: his movements are incredibly fast and precise, even in this relaxed play. I mention this in an academic letter of recommendation because I believe this passion and self-discipline he has for fighting is a significant source of his many good qualities.

I think it's important to mention first that Stan is always the friendliest person in the room. His energy is always manifested in kindness, and never has he spoken a harsh word or shown any sign of disrespect to me or his peers. In class discussions he would just as happily take the lead to take notes on the board, moderate, or make the first comment as he would remain in the background to give space to others. When working in groups he would often lead naturally, keeping everyone on-task. He has, I believe, the universal respect of his peers and teachers, and his outgoing good-nature always made a difference in the classroom.

Stan is also an incredibly hard worker. For example, I assigned a paper at one point in the year, and he completed it going above and beyond the word-minimum but at least a page or two. Unfortunately, he misunderstood the assignment, and he didn't actually do the paper I had asked for. Students often make this mistake, and I give them a chance to rewrite the assignment and we decide on a deadline sometime in the next few weeks. When I explained this to Stan though, he apologized and took his work back, and he told me he would have it rewritten by the next day. I didn't really believe him, but sure enough the next day he found me and presented me with an excellent paper. That's the kind of kid Stan is: he's both motivated and self-disciplined. He knows how to get things done.

Of course, high school students with self-discipline tend to find academic success, and this is certainly the case with Stan. He's an excellent writer and a strong critical reader. I would have confidence in him in a class of demanding rigor and coursework, and in fact it's in this setting where I think he will do best. I hope you will give him a chance to impress you as he did me.

\closing{Sincerely,}
