\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Kevin Rodriguez to your undergraduate academic program. I have known Kevin for a little more than a year as his junior and senior year English teacher, and I can say with confidence that Kevin is a good, promising student.

Kevin comes to class every day with a positive attitude, and he applies himself well to whatever he works on. He is reliable, energetic, and shows promising skills in critical reading and academic writing. Kevin never misses an assignment, never misses class, and always works to the best of his ability. In the classroom, he is a quiet student, but engaged---he's the kind of student who stands out not through theatrics but through the force of his good character. He associates with other good students, and works well in any group I put him in.

That's the thing about Kevin: he's someone who seems naturally to take advantage of the educational opportunities he encounters. Through diligent application of effort I've seen him grow a lot over the past year and a half. I sincerely believe that his responsible and persistent disposition along with his innate positivity will make him an asset to any class, team, or community that he joins. I hope you give him the chance to show you what he can do.

\closing{Sincerely,}
