\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Daniel Andrade to your undergraduate academic program. Daniel was my student last year in English 3, and he remains my student in English 4. Daniel is a highly engaged student, and a pleasure to have in the classroom.

Last year, Daniel made his presence known early through his lively participation in class. Many students talk in our class discussions and small groups, but Daniel is different. He is the kind of kid who asks challenging questions just as much as he proposes his own ideas. He quickly made himself into such a significant member of the class community that it made a material difference in my lesson if he wasn't around. Daniel is genuinely interested in, and thinking about, the world around him, and this makes him a rewarding student to teach.

This year, of course, things are different. Our district is teaching full-remote, and we have been for the entire year. When I begin my class virtually, I see a screen where all my students' cameras are off. But Daniel is still acting the same as before, and the habit to engage in academic discourse, ask questions, and think through problems has not diminished in the least despite the difficult circumstances. Now more than ever I rely on Daniel's participation to bring life to our activities and discussions, and because he has the friendship and respect of the other students, he draws them out too. So in one great way, this year is just like the last, and I am thankful for this.

If you give Daniel a chance to join your academic community, you'll have a lively, confident learner who I am certain will make great use of the opportunities you provide. Not only that, but I also believe he'll be an asset to your community in general through his kindness and good character. I hope you give him this chance.

\closing{Sincerely,}
