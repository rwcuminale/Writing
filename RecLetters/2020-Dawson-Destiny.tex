\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to strongly recommend Destiny Dawson for undergraduate studies. 
Destiny was my student last year in English 3, and she proved herself to be a strong English student and a delight to have in the classroom.

Thinking back on last year, my first recollection of Destiny is of a student with a lot of confidence, positivity, and an outgoing personality.
In class she's not afraid to offer her ideas or opinions during class discussions, and takes leadership roles in group work and collaborative learning.
Destiny has a disposition to engage with the world around her: when that environment is academic, she is academic; when it's relaxed, she's social and gregarious.
Almost immediately Destiny becomes a valuable member of the classroom.

Of course, it's also important to have the ability to succeed in rigorous academic studies, and Destiny has shown herself capable in her reading, writing, and thinking.
Her ideas are interesting and original, her writing clear, and she can handle the difficult texts a course sometimes throws at students.
On top of this, she is also singularly \emph{funny}, and I've always found humor to be a mark of intelligence. 
And Destiny also shows a level of responsibility beyond her peers: not only does she manage her own workload successfully---never missing an assignment and completing the honors program despite the challenges of the COVID shutdown---but I often observed her helping her peers and holding them accountable.

If you accept Destiny to your academic community, you will have a student who makes the most of her opportunities and makes opportunities for others. Give Destiny a chance, and I have every confidence she will reward your faith in her.

\closing{Sincerely,}
