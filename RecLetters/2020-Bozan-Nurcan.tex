\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Nurcan Bozan to your undergraduate academic program. I have known Nurcan now for a little more than a year as her English teacher, and I know her to be a skilled, good-natured student.

Nurcan is a good student, always present and engaged with a positive attitude. Never late to class, never late on assignments, she is certainly one of my most reliable students, and she always puts in a good effort on whatever she attempts. Consequently, she has shown herself to be a capable critical reader and a thoughtful writer. In class, she works well with everyone, and is a lively member of any group I put her in.

Outside of class, I often see her cheerfully chatting with friends in the hallways, and Nurcan strikes me as a student who is quiet, but not reserved. She is more of a listener than a speaker in class discussions, but that doesn't mean she won't jump in when she has a point she wants to make or volunteer to take on a leadership role in come collaborative activity. She shows respect for everyone, and receives it in turn. Nurcan is a good student to have in the class not only because she is a good learner, but she's a happy, kind person.

If you accept Nurcan for undergraduate students, I am certain she will be a positive contribution both to the classroom communities she joins, and the greater academic community in general. I sincerely hope you give her that chance. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
