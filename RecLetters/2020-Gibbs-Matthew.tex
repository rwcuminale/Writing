\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Matthew Gibbs to your undergraduate academic program. I taught Matthew last year when he was a Junior in English 3, and this year I teach him in English 4. He is a lively, good-natured student who shows a maturity that I think will lead him to success.

When I think back to my memories of Matthew, the first thing that comes to mind is the joy he brings to the classroom. Always smiling, he brings a candid sense of humor, backed by intelligence, to every class. While in class that positivity manifested in energy he directed at his studies, and I found him to be an interesting, responsive student. At his best, he is the kind of student who can raise the engagement of the students around him through his enthusiasm, and make a strong impact on the classroom environment. I sincerely value having him as a student.

Matthew's good humor and playfulness belies a sense of adulthood too, I think. I find in his writing and his contributions to class a level of sophistication and sometimes gravity that show promise. We've all met people who would joke around but all of a sudden say something surprisingly profound, and I see that in Matthew. There's a sense of the importance of the bigger things in life, and he's growing in the right direction. In the undergraduate world, I imagine Matthew finding himself and thriving. He has a sharp, alert mind that, as he discovers his own paths and interests will make him a strong member of your academic community. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
