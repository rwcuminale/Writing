\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to take this opportunity strongly to recommond Solomon Roby to your undergraduate academic program. I have known Solomon now as his English teacher both in Junior and Senior year, and he is a student with a great deal of promise. He has a strong combination of curiosity and confidence that make him a delight to have in the classroom.

		First off, Solomon (or Solo, as he likes to be called), is a bright and capable student. He picks up on the subtleties of literary texts and is able to express himself well in writing. What I believe sets Solo apart, however, is his attitude in the classroom. He is always the first to volunteer whenever there's a job to be done. He's taken notes for the class on the white-board as many times as he's volunteered to moderate a student-led class discussion. In groups, his energy keeps the team moving forward, and without being overbearing he gets the job done. Whenever there is a difficult question, he's always trying to answer it, and he takes on challenging prompts in his writing. These signs represent to me an authentic learner, and a potential scholar.

I'm excited for Solo's future. High school is a program of studies that offers little flexibility for students to pursue their curiosities. Solo's energy will undoubtedly lead him in new and interesting directions. Not only that, but the reason I believe he will be such an asset to your academic community is due to his honest enthusiasm for learning about the world around him. I am highly confident he will be a joy to your professors in their classrooms, and I am equally sure he will raise the standards of those around him too. I hope you give him the chance to take on your challenges and show you what he can do.

\closing{Sincerely,}
