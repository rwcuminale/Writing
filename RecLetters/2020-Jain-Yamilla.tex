\opening{To whom it may concern:}

It is my pleasure strongly to recommend Yamila Jain to your academic program. This is my second year teaching Yamila, having taught her both in English 3 last year and now in senior-year English 4, and in both classes she distinguishes herself as a curious, responsible, and capable student.

Last year, Yamila was the kind of student always present and alert in the classroom, nodding her head and asking questions during direct-instruction, and working hard with her peers during collaborative learning. She made thoughtful contributions to class discussions, and her writing showed a sincere engagement not only with the course texts, but with the issues and themes surrounding them. I always got the impression that Yamila was doing her best to learn instead of working to complete the tasks and requirements of the course.

Perhaps an anecdote will shed more light on her academic disposition. When schools shut down because of the pandemic last year, Yamilla had been working on a major project. It was due by the end of the year, and she was really struggling to complete it. At the time, I think we were all struggling just to get from one end of the day to another, and when she reached out over email to alert me to her difficulties in completing the project, I certainly couldn't blame her. The important thing is that, while other students had figured out that the grades weren't going to be counted, Yamila still cared about fulfilling her responsibilities. She didn't just abandon it, but wrote a difficult email to a teacher to see what could be done. We wound up modifying the project a bit to work better in the quarantine situation, and she completed it with enthusiasm. I can honestly say she was one of my best students last year, because she brought this attitude to everything she attempted.

In undergraduate studies, I am excited for Yamila to continue to pursue learning and self-discovery. She thrives in an educational environment, and I believe she has a lot to offer your academic community. If you give her the opportunity to join your program, I am certain she will be a joy to her professors and fellow students as she works hard to make the most of it.


\closing{Sincerely,}
