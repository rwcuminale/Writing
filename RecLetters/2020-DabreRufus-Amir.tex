\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to recommend Amir Dabre Rufus to your undergraduate education program. I know Amir as his English teacher last year, and he was a lively, intelligent student.

When I think back on my experiences with Amir, I remember most his positive presence in the classroom. He was a student who brought a strong sense of humor, and a lot of energy to every class. Always ready to learn, I remember him doing his best at whatever challenges I threw at him. Consequently, I saw him grow both as a reader and a writer throughout the year. He showed solid skills in text analysis and the responsibility to take ownership of his education.

In college or university, I think Amir will continue to do well. He absolutely has the spark to make the most of the opportunities ahead. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
