\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I would like to strongly recommend Jaylon Redmond to your undergraduate academic program. I know Jaylon as his English 3 teacher last year, and he's a strong English student with good character.

Jaylon is the quiet kid in class. It's often hard to write about the quiet students since, because they don't create events in the classroom, it can be difficult to find a strong anecdote that captures who he is (of course, the abbreviated year complicates this even further). Nevertheless, it's easy to write with confidence about Jaylon, because he is consistent.

First, Jaylon is consistently present in the classroom. First, he was physically present as, almost always, one of the first students to arrive to class and prepare for the work ahead. Standing at the board, and turning around, Jaylon was also always present with his attention and eye-contact. He sat with academically strong students by choice, and held their respect, and when the students worked in groups his diligent presence would lead through example. There is no doubt that on any given day Jaylon was there to learn.

Secondly, the reading, writing, and speaking Jaylon did throughout the course showed his classroom presence was resulting in real academic growth. His papers were clearly written and thoughtful, and showed authentic engagement with the course texts. He asked good questions, and chose challenging ideas for his writing, and this paid off as I saw him grow throughout the year. He is a skilled and capable English student.

Third, I see kindness in Jaylon, and good character. He always got along with anyone I had him working with, and it's impossible for me to imagine a harsh word from him. Jaylon also showed responsibility when would take the initiative and communicate with me whenever there may arise an issue, and he was always on top of his grades and his work. During parent-teacher conferences he would come with his mother, and their love and respect for each other were evident, and to me it's just another sign that he's just a really good kid.

Quiet kids don't always get the sparkling recommendations, but this one deserves it. I hope you take the time to get to know Jaylon, and let him become a part of your community. I am certain you will not regret it.

\closing{Sincerely,}
